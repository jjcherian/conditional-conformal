# Conditional Conformal

`conditionalconformal` is a Python package for conformal prediction with 
conditional guarantees.

For example, given a collection of groups $\mathcal{G}$, `conditionalconformal` issues
a prediction set $\hat{C}(\cdot)$ satisfying

$$\mathbb{P}(Y_{n + 1} \in \hat{C}(X_{n + 1}) \mid X \in G) \geq 1 - \alpha \quad \text{for all $G \in \mathcal{G}$}.$$ 

Alternatively, given a collection of covariate shifts $\mathcal{F}$, the package issues
a prediction set $\hat{C}(\cdot)$ satisfying 

$$\mathbb{P}_ f(Y_{n + 1} \in \hat{C}(X_{n + 1})) \geq 1 - \alpha \quad \text{for all $f \in \mathcal{F}$}.$$ 


If the collection of shifts is unknown, we also provide a methodology
for providing finite-sample guarantees over arbitrary shifts. To query for the guarantee (which can
depend on the shift of interest), we provide the `estimate_coverage` function.

## Installation

conditionalconformal can be installed with pip.

```bash
$ pip install conditionalconformal
```

## Examples

The easiest way to start using conditionalconformal may be to go through the following notebook:

## Usage

### The `CondConf` Class

The `CondConf` class has the following API:
```python
class CondConf:
    def __init__(
            self, 
            score_fn : Callable,
            Phi_fn : Callable,
            infinite_params : dict = {}
        ):
        """
        Constructs the CondConf object that caches relevant information for
        generating conditionally valid prediction sets.

        We define the score function and set of conditional guarantees
        that we care about in this function.

        Parameters
        ---------
        score_fn : Callable[np.ndarray, np.ndarray] -> np.ndarray
            Fixed (vectorized) conformity score function that takes in
            X and Y as inputs and returns S as output

        Phi_fn : Callable[np.ndarray] -> np.ndarray
            Function that defines finite basis set that we provide
            exact conditional guarantees over

        infinite_params : dict = {}
            Dictionary containing parameters for the RKHS component of the fit
            Valid keys are ('kernel', 'gamma', 'lambda')
                'kernel' should be a valid kernel name for sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels
                'gamma' is a hyperparameter for certain kernels
                'lambda' is the regularization penalty applied to the RKHS component

        setup_problem sets up the final fitting problem for a 
        particular calibration set

        estimate_coverage estimates the true percentile of the issued estimate of the
